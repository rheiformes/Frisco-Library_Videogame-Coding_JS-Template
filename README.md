 

## Project Information:
This is a template I created for use for the Intro to Videogame Coding for Middle Schoolers class series I launched at Frisco Library. This one uses JavaScript, and participants can use Microsoft MakeCode Arcade (available on browser) as a code editor and simulators. 

I have uploaded this on GitHub for easy use to download all code and assets directly into MakeCode as an extension. You can see those directions below (provided by MakeCode)

To just see the code editor/environment in MakeCode Arcade itself, you can go to this link here: https://makecode.com/_06cE9xDbY2dg
