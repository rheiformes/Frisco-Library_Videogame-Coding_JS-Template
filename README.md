 

## Project Information:
This is a template I created for use for the Intro to Videogame Coding for Middle Schoolers class series I launched at Frisco Library. This one uses JavaScript, and participants can use Microsoft MakeCode Arcade (available on browser) as a code editor and simulators. 

I have uploaded this on GitHub for easy use to import all code and assets directly into MakeCode as an extension. It also makes it easier to share the project to librarians and others interested in the classes. You can see those directions below (automatic text provided by MakeCode)

Also, to just see the code editor/environment in MakeCode Arcade itself, you can go to this link here: https://makecode.com/_06cE9xDbY2dg
